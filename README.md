# Uber-Supply-Demand-Gap-Analysis
The cab company faced the problem of supply demand gap when most of their trips from city to airport or airport to city were cancelled for unknown reasons. Methods: Various kinds of plots and graphs were made and feature engineering was done to analyze the trend of cab request made and trips completed. The plots included histogram, stacked bar chart and many more. Result: After the detailed analysis of the data it was visible that the gap in supply and demand came due to the location of airport being very far from the city or in the outskirts of the city and the incoming flights in morning were more and outgoing flights were less which resulted in less gas mileage for the cab drivers thus declining the requests.
